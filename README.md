# DataUtility

DataUtility is a lightweight, modular Python utility library built on top of **pandas** to simplify **data cleaning, exploration, and preprocessing**.

It is designed for students and practitioners who want a **clear, safe, and reusable toolkit** for everyday data tasks without over-engineering.

## Motivation

In many university projects, hackathons, and exploratory machine learning workflows, the same steps are repeated:

- inspecting datasets  
- handling missing values  
- detecting outliers  
- encoding and scaling features  
- creating derived features  

DataUtility groups these operations into a **single, consistent interface** so you can focus on analysis and modeling instead of rewriting boilerplate code.
